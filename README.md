<h1>Hello, I'm Anthony!<br/></h1>

<h2>👋 About Me</h2>
I am a rising junior studying Cybersecurity at the University of Cincinnati with goals to involve myself in PenTesting and Threat intelligence. Passionate about leadership and seeing my team thrive, I'm seeking an IT/Cybersecurity internship over the summer to grow my skills in the field in a friendly team environment. <br />
This repository is for current and future project developments with the intent of using, documenting, and analyzing Cybersecurity labs in order to learn and improve on various aspects of Cybersecurity. This repository will be updated with in-progress and completed projects.
